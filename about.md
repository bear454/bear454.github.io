**James Mason: Technical Architect, Public Cloud @ SUSE**

James is working hard to make SUSE Linux rock in the public cloud. He's been working on various projects at SUSE since 2010, and has been working with Linux since 2001. His first distro was S.u.S.E Linux 7.1.

James lives, works, and plays in beautiful Bellingham, WA. His daughter prefers KDE or GNOME over OS X, and his son spends more time thinking about Minecraft than its developers.
