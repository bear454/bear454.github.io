They advertise '<a href="http://www.siliconmechanics.com/c1114/expert-support-services.php">Expert Included</a>', implying you will receive top-notch support along with an excellent server.   What that fails to imply is the amazing support you'll get before you order.<br /><br />I submitted a quote through their web site, and requested the idle noise level of the server: something they're not currently publishing.  Within 48 hours I got an email from <a href="mailto:tim.groen@siliconmechanics.com">Tim Groen</a>, a member of their <a href="mailto:sales@siliconmechanics.com">sales team</a>, apologizing for the delay.  In the meantime they had pulled a server, ordered a sound level meter, found a quiet room and tested the server.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Wow #1</span>.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the server as quoted was louder than I was willing to tolerate (I work in the same room as our server rack).  Tim asked a few questions about my priorities on the system, and what I would be willing to give up to get it quieter.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, I got another quote via email.  Same system, but labeled 'quiet cousin'.  Instead of chopping out any of my requested features, they opted to custom tune the system, with a guaranteed maximum SPL within my tolerances.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Wow #2</span>.<br /><br />I got a call from Tim today, informing be the system was going to be a tad more expensive than originally quoted, as they were replacing the standard fans with something quieter.  I approved the price change and got another email, which showed the fans they were including: <a href="http://www.sunon.com.tw/english/wealth/tech/tech-05.htm#C">maglev fans</a>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Wow #3</span>.  I had no idea there were such things, but having experienced a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev_train">maglev train</a> I am expecting a rather quiet server.<br /><br />Tim also told me to expect delivery next week; a full week ahead of their original estimate.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Wow #4</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span><br /><br />The server was delivered today, and unwrapped Christmas-morning-style.  My co-hort and I bench-tested the server, and were very pleased with the noise level.  Then the fans spun down after POST.  I admit it; we giggled.  The system is quieter than we expected, by far.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Wow #5</span>. <br /><br />In the rack, compared to the rest of the noisemakers, I can't tell the server is running, save for a subtle low-frequency hum.  Now to get <a href="http://www.opensuse.org">openSUSE</a> running on it, and start <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_virtualization">virtualizing</a> (noisy boxes go first)!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size:85%;">Full disclosure: <a href="http://www.siliconmechanics.com/">Silicon Mechanics</a> sponsors my local Linux event, <a href="http://lfnw.org/">Linuxfest Northwest.</a></span></div>
