<br /><br />LinuxFest Northwest 2013 is April 27th &amp; 28th in *beautiful* Bellingham, WA!<br /><br />LFNW is an annual event produced by the Bellingham Linux Users Group ( <a href="http://blug.org/">http://blug.org</a> ), and volunteers from other northwest U.S. open source users groups. This is a free event and produced entirely by volunteers, and features Linux and open source experts and aficionados sharing their experience and enthusiasm. This generally means that there will be a lot of smart people who come with something to share and a desire to learn.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/">http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org</a><br /><br />openSUSE is sponsoring LFNW, so its important we make the best of our community investment in this enthusiastic crowd (last year Jos got to see firsthand what it looks like when 1500 enthusiastic Linux users hit a conference hall). <br /><br />I still need a few committed, knowledgeable community members who are comfortable networking in a big diverse crowd.  As a benefit of our sponsorship, we will have a luxurious 100 sq.ft. space on the booth floor. Used well, we can actually bring folks in and work with them 1:1 - doing installs, teaching techniques, sharing stories: anything that helps this *awesome* Linux community understand that openSUSE is like a warm group hug. If you can help out, please get a hold of me via <a href="mailto:bear454@opensuse.org" target="_blank">email</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/bear454" target="_blank">twitter</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com/bear454" target="_blank">faceboo<span id="goog_110627819"></span><span id="goog_110627820"></span>k</a>, <a href="http://gplus.to/bear454" target="_blank">g+</a> or whatever, as soon as possible.<br /><br />Cheers - and here's to seeing you at the end of April!<br /><br />
