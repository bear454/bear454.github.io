title: "BLUG Logo Drafts (v1)"
---

Over at LFNW, we've been working with a student in graphic design, who has done some great work for us. She designed both the well received Individual Supporter and Staff t-shirts, and she's working on a new logo and visual design for LFNW, which we're pretty excited about.

As a side project, we also asked for some drafts of a logo for the Bellingham Linux Users Group - we've never had a proper logo, but as LFNW grows, we want to highlight BLUG's role in creating the event, and so want to have a better "visual profile".

Here are the first round of drafts... we'll discuss these briefly at the [next BLUG meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Bellingham-Linux-User-Group-BLUG/events/ffprjmyxnbgb/).
