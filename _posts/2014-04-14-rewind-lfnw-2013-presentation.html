I realized, while prepping for <a href="http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/" target="_blank">LinuxFest Northwest 2014</a>, that I'd never published my <a href="http://2013.linuxfestnorthwest.org/content/choosing-js-framework" target="_blank">2013 presentation</a> here. So...<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Looking to build a web application?&nbsp; You're going to want a JS  framework to give your app some structure, and save yourself from  building a new bowl of spaghetti code. </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">The problem is, we're spoiled for choice.&nbsp; I'll sum up what I learned  trying to find 'the right solution':&nbsp; what options I evaluated; how I  trimmed the fat and picked criteria to make a reasonable choice for a  particular app; then spent some time actually building a small demo app  to get in the groove.</blockquote>Slides: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3tWJmdmsqFIcnJsZGVjeTJ3WXM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">ODP</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3tWJmdmsqFIUS0ycG1hZWp1NzA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">PDF</a>
