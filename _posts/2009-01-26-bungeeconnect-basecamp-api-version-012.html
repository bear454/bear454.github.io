I (finally) updated the BungeeConnect Basecamp API this morning, with the following improvements:<br /><ul><li>Milestones and Todo-Items no longer error out during the uncomplete function.</li><li>Getting archived messages correctly uses the AbbreviatedPost class, instead of the Post class.</li></ul>The following issues are still outstanding:<br /><ul><li>TimeEntry methods are not well tested, as this is a premium feature.  I've asked 37Signals for access to TimeEntries for testing &amp; development.</li><li>Update methods are still failing out.  BungeeLabs is working with me to resolve this issue.</li></ul>Prerequisites (unchanged):<br /><ul><li>A <a href="http://www.bungeeconnect.com/signup/">BungeeConnect account</a>.</li><li>A <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/signup">Basecamp account</a>.  To use SSL and manage Time Entries, you need at least a Plus Account.</li></ul>
