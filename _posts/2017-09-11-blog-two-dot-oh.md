**Time for a fresh start.**

I'm done with Blogger, and I don't even have to link over to the old blog, as [jekyll-import](http://import.jekyllrb.com/) did a dandy job of bringing it all along.

Hopefully, now that I can write in my editor of choice, review locally, and post as easily as `git push`, I'll actually get back around to doing the short, semiregular content I've always wanted to post here. _Wish me luck!_
