I've been writing <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> for almost 9 years now, and I love it. Ruby, for those who don't know it, is an extremely expressive, natural coding language with roots in Perl and Smalltalk. I comment less in Ruby than any other language I've ever used, because the code tends to be clear and self-documenting. The community has a great ethos, driven by concepts like TDD/BDD (test or behavior driven development), DRY (don't repeat yourself), YAGNI (you ain't gonna need it), and convention-over-configuration.<br /><br />I've been writing <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> for about 18 months now, and it's an amazingly powerful language, with a huge wealth of libraries and resources. I don't love it. In fact, the more I use it, the less I like it. Doing a project in Django has really spiked that feeling. It's not that Python sucks, per se, I just feel like a lot of the lessons I've learned in the last 35 years of coding, and many of the concepts I've gotten used to as a Rubyist just don't apply, and that makes me grumpy.<br /><br />This <a href="http://blug.org/meetings/general/blug-meeting-thurs-feb-4th-btc" target="_blank">Thursday, February 4th</a>, I'll be presenting for the <a href="http://blug.org/" target="_blank">Bellingham Linux Users Group</a>, where I'll expound further, hopefully amusingly and enlighteningly, on this topic.<br /><br />Thursday, Feb 4, at 7pm in <a href="http://www.btc.edu/AboutBTC/HowToFindUs/indexHowToFindUs.aspx?tab=tab3" target="_blank">BTC</a> room <a href="http://www.btc.edu/images/AboutBTC/HowToFindUs/CampusMaps-General-Large.jpg" target="_blank">CC201</a>.
