You should go to LinuxFest Northwest 2008, Saturday &amp; Sunday April 26th, 27th at Bellingham Technical College, in Bellingham, WA.  No admission, no need to register, although I do recommend bringing a few $ for the <a href="http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/lunch.html">salmon barbecue</a> and the <a href="http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/raffle.html">World Famous Raffle</a>.  Print out a <a href="http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/poster.html">poster</a> and stick it somewhere visible.  Or connect other attendees, through the <a href="http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/about.html">social nets</a>.  And don't forget to thank our <a href="http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/sponsors.html">sponsors</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://lfnw.org/">http://lfnw.org</a><br /><br />As a presenter, I feel compelled to plug myself:<br /><ul><li>I'll be presenting on my experiences implementing FOSS in an established business, Sunday afternoon at 1:00pm.</li><li>I'll be cloning myself and participating in two Birds of a Feather sessions; openSUSE users, and multi-OS environments, Sunday afternoon at 3:00 pm.</li><li>I'll be doing a bit of booth duty for openSUSE Sunday morning.<br /></li></ul>As a well supported BCDN developer, I feel compelled to plug <a href="http://bungeelabs.com">Bungee Labs</a>:<br /><ul><li>'Reverend' Ted Haeger will be talking about Software-as-a-Service (and his new favorite buzzphrase Platform-as-a-Service I'm sure) and open-source.  Licensing coolness and making money, and hopefully, showing off the <a href="http://bungeeconnect.com">BungeeConnect</a> environment, on Saturday at 1:30pm.</li></ul>The <a href="http://blug.org/fest2008/schedule.dxp">full presenter schedule is online</a>, but subject to change until the day-of.<br /><br />As a member of BLUG, I've been otherwise armtwisted, cajoled, and downright shamed into plugging the event.<br /><br />So come. Please.  Before those with more infuence than I start doing worse than armtwisting... ;)
