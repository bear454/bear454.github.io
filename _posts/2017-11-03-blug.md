title: "BLUG: Developer Tools for Desktop Users"
---

On [Thursday, Nov 2, 2017](https://www.meetup.com/Bellingham-Linux-User-Group-BLUG/events/244192000/), I presented for the [Bellingham Linux Users Group](http://blug.org) "Developer tools for Desktop Users".

We talked about using `git` for versioning documents & configuration, using diff tools like `meld` to analyze system logs, and did a little Q&A on some deeper topics.

Of course, no presentation is truly complete without a failed demo - I tried to post this last night (showing [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for quick, easy, free web hosting) and totally failed. I've spent a little time this morning digging through, and as far as I can tell, the problem was upstream at github... but the error message is sufficiently vague to prevent ever knowing _why_.

Oh well. One day later, here are the [slides]({{ "/assets/DTfDU.pdf" | absolute_url }}). Thanks to those who attended!
