This morning the GMail team blogged about a new feature for the Google Mobile Apps - a map view of your contact list... nice.<br /><br />Although this has been seen before (I'm sure there's an iPhone commercial of something similar), Google will make it significantly more useful by not limiting it to a single platform: the app has runs on Android, Blackberry, S60, Windows Mobile at launch, and (eventually) will support the iPhone.<br /><br />This just makes me miss my Blackberry even more...<br /><br /><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/see-where-your-friends-are-with-google.html">Official Gmail Blog: See where your friends are with Google Latitude</a>
