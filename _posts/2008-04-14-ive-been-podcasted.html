<img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/bungee-media/image/bungee-audio-logo_80.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />At the tail end of their <a href="http://bungeeconnect.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/update-from-john-musser-of-programmableweb/">most recent podcast</a>, <a href="http://reverendted.wordpress.com/">Ted Haeger</a>, (co-)host of the <a href="http://bungeeconnect.wordpress.com/">Bungee Line</a>, mentioned yours truly.  Feels like winning something on the radio.  There goes 3 more of my 15 seconds.<br /><br />Oh yeah, he mentions the upcoming <a href="http://lfnw.org/">LinuxFest Northwest 2008</a> as well.  I'll be presenting on some lessons I've learning bringing open source into a business.  Ted will be presenting on sneaky ways of making money renting free software ;-)
