<div style="text-align: center;"><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.javapassion.com/rubyonrails/">http://www.javapassion.com/rubyonrails/</a><br /></div><br />Starting July 15th, <a href="http://www.javapassion.com/SangShinSchedule.html#Bio">Sang Shin</a>, a Java architect and evangelist from <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>, will be leading an online course on developing Ruby on Rails applications, including the use of JRuby.  The free course includes 20 weekly lessons (including homework - bah) starting with Ruby fundamentals and working through all the major Rails areas, closing with four complete Rails applications.  Of course, Sang will focus the materials on using the free, open-source <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans IDE</a> and <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby runtime</a>.<br /><br />I'll be acting as an Advisor for the course (the open-source version of a T.A.) along with five other members of a very diverse group.  With 998 members and counting, anyone should be able to find a study-group to help out; groups have already formed with cultural themes - Indians, Brazilians, Mexicans, Syrians, etc.<br /><br />So, if you're interested in learning the nuts and bolts of building a Rails application, join the group by sending an email to <a href="mailto:ruby-on-rails-programming-with-passion-subscribe@googlegroups.com">ruby-on-rails-programming-with-passion-subscribe@googlegroups.com</a> or visiting the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-on-rails-programming-with-passion">group site</a>.
