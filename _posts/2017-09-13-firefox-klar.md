**TL;DR: Firefox Klar (a.k.a Focus) is free enough to hit F-Droid**

I'm trying harder to protect my personal privacy, and in order to guarantee that I'm trying to use more open source apps.

I was really excited about [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org)'s [launch](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/06/20/firefox-focus-new-to-android-blocks-annoying-ads-and-protects-your-privacy/) of [Firefox Focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/focus/) on Android, a mobile browser designed around privacy. Ironically, Firefox Focus was not avialable on F-Droid, because it contains non-free, binary tracking libraries(here's the [report](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues/171)). *sigh*. Back to [Lightning](https://f-droid.org/packages/acr.browser.lightning/) I went.

> **SIDEBAR:** check out [Lighting](https://github.com/anthonycr/Lightning-Browser), if you're looking for a lightweight, but more conventionally featured browser. It's got really cool [tab](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1pKW8t_4p73Ac2oheH6PH2QxK72leuhpucpAZdmv1ASg764hRQnTrLjC5iI5tSyJrQ=h900-rw) & [bookmark](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CgXeLv11CXF1Cl-tfKwWqSods7l0em-xpEZfq-cnkBX951Q59ToM3jXPr8NDynKJq-c=h900-rw) interfaces!

Well, apparently the Germans wouldn't stand for that, and [Firefox Klar](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-firefox-klar-android) was released, sans trackers. It's [Focus](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/difference-between-firefox-focus-and-firefox-klar), just without all the tracking binaries... and it's in [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.klar/). *W00t.*
